Topic: banshee, fedora core 5 and my ipod :)
Date: 2006-03-26

Thought I'd post my screenshot of banshee syncing with my ipod without going through any crazy modifications. I plug it in load up my music library and sync away :)Though there are issues with banshee and SMP kernels, however, that should be fixed in banshee 10.9 which I've successfully built on FC5 without any hassle.So if you were hesitant to switching to linux because of itunes (yes there are some of you out there that is being held back because of this) then fc5 and banshee is your answer :)
