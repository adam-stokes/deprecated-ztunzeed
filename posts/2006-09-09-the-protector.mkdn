Ok so remember when I posted about Tony jaa's next movie to hit the US in december ? (Story here) Well it came earlier than expected with a subtitle re-write and I think an excellent job of voice overs.There hasn't been many movies I can safely say I enjoyed primarly due to poor voice overs, I definately prefer subtitles over anything else.But back to the movie.. If you go in there with the mindset that, yes, this is a movie that will have a close to nothing plot but more action than you can care about then you will definately enjoy this. I'm not going into reviews or anything of this movie because I hate typing that much and my grammar skills are barely average :) so you will have to go see the movie for yourself!Besides other people do reviews for a living :Hollywood.comFilmthreat.comand many more ...
