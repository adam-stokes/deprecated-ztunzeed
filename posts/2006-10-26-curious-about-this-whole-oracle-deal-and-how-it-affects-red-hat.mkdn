Date: 2006-10-26

Read on my friends, read on ..http://www.redhat.com/promo/unfakeable/And for those of you who haven't read our magazine yet, then now's the time to check that out RH Magazine. Tons of great information for Fedora and RHEL users (I always enjoy the Tips and Tricks written by my fellow co-workers)Hmm what else ... oh yes, have an issue on RHEL that you can't figure out? Perhaps you are curious about "Setting up device-mapper multipathing in RHEL4" or maybe you want to "configure kerberos against a Active Directory server"? Then you need to head on over to our excellent Knowledgebase that contains thousands of articles written by Red Hat engineers to aid you in just about anything you need to know.Ok enough advertising :)P.S. - Fedora Core 6 kicks ass K?
