Had the opportunity to watch Rocky Balboa tonight and I was impressed. I've always enjoyed the Rocky series though it seemed to be going downhill towards the end.. I mean, really, how many boxing movies can you make before things start getting redundant?In any case, very enjoyable and possibly a little inspirational *tear* and I recommend taking a night out to see it in theaters.
