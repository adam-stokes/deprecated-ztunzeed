Topic: Switching over to blogger
Date: 2006-12-27

I think I'll be switching over all blog content, documentation to Blogger and Google docs/spreadsheets.My current site http://astokes.org will continue to be active, however, it will carry different type of information which I haven't decided on just yet.There is also no need to create a wiki on my current site because each project created with http://code.google.com contains a wiki within itself :)
