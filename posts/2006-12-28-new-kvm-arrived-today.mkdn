Topic: New KVM arrived today
Date: 2006-12-28

Purchased TRENDnet TK-400K KVM Switch Kit and got it all hooked up tonight. Running both Fedora Core 6 and Windows XP it works flawlessly :) As you can see on newegg.com the price is great and the reviews are excellent.Haven't actually played counterstrike through the kvm yet so not sure how well the responsiveness is, but I would imagine I won't see any differences. In any case, this makes it a helluva lot easier to switch between my pc's than moving cables around all midieval style :|In the web development world I've been messing around with django to see if this framework will suite my needs. I like the idea that they don't want to include all this junk in it, i.e. AJAX helpers and what not. There is no need to include these so called helpers because frameworks like Mochikit make including AJAX capability in your web applications a breeze. Furthermore, I think web applications should contain all functionality necessary to make a useuable and functional application, then worry about adding the AJAX 'l33tness' later on.
