Finally got my wall mount in for the lcd I bought a few months back. Cost was decent, around 55 bucks and it holds up to 40" or 80lbs. The TV is a Samsung S4051D and the wall mount is a Sanus Systems visionmount (black).Heres some pictures of the setup. I am still working on pulling the cables through the wall, however, I'm waiting until I can pick out a decent surround sound before I go digging through the joys of wiring :D
