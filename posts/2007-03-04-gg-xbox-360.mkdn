Topic: GG xbox 360
Date: 2007-03-04

I decided to go out and get me a xbox 360 this weekend and after 2 exchanges and a tank of gas I am finally enjoying it.Why 2 exchanges? Well thanks to either a bad shipment, certain models, or just Microsoft being gay(second meaning) the HDD was bad. The HDD continued to suck ass until I finally went to another Best Buy and exchanged it for a 3rd and hopefully final time.Anyway, once the xbox started and got going it is pretty h4wt. I purchased Gears of War because of all the good things I heard about it and to me they were all true. GoW is a definate purchase for any FPS fan.I haven't had a chance to look into Arcade or any of the other marketplace items available to me so I'm not sure if I download a HD movie if I have it for life or if its a one time download and once it is removed from your HDD thats it?I plan on picking up Fight Night 3, Madden 07, and possibly Rainbow Six : Vegas or Lost Planet :)
