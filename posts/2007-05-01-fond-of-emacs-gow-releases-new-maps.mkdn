Topic: fond of emacs, GoW releases new maps
Date: 2007-05-01

Damn I hate titles, hardest thing to think of when writing a blog post.So, picked up a few more titles for the 360 -- Guitar Hero II and G.R.A.W 2 and they both own your F4CE. However, some people seem to feel that its "momo" but who cares I enjoy feeling like a goober. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to play the multiplayer mode on GRAW2 but I did glance at the server stats and there seems to be quite a bit of people online. Its just too bad Microsoft doesn't understand the concept of hosting dedicated servers for these games so we go on getting shotgun'd by the host who apparently think they are _that_ awesome, but that is another rant at another time.In the *nix world I've decided to start learning Emacs. The learning curve is actually less than it was when I decided to work solely with Vi. They were right when stating emacs is like an operating system in itself and it goes nicely along with my screen session (do more with less terminals :-)There are a few newly developed projects that have caught my eye, mainly those revolving around virtualization and systems management as well as easier and more advanced clustering administration. It is interesting to see the power behind python and ruby *unfortunately* when it comes to *hopefully* production quality applications. If you've not had a chance to take a look at these new technologies I _highly_ suggest you do so because in my eyes this is should be a big involvement from the community.Oh, one last thing Gears of War released 4 new maps today :D get your g4me f4c3 on!
