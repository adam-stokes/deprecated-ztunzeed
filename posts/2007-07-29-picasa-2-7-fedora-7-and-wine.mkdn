This is for all you Ubuntu fanboys -- see how easy it is in Fedora too :\

    # yum install wine

*Download Picasa from http://picasa.google.com (The windows executable)

    # wine picasaweb-current-setup.exe

Clicky clicky, and watch Picasa start in all its glory.. I've also
been messing around with Eclipse 3.3 again along with some various
plugins that make this IDE more feature complete. If you are
interested take a look at these plugins that will help make your
development experience more enjoyable
:)pydevc/c++phpperlsubversionmylyn (bugzilla, trac integration)They
all come with code assist/completions, tasks templating, scm
annotations (at least in svn plugin), gdb integration, and tons more.
