Got a chance to check out 'I am Legend' last night and I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped for. In any case still a good movie just feels like it was missing something -- perhaps going deeper into the sci-fi part and not so much zombies?Pass few months I've been recently promoted to Support Engineer ( kind of like a level 3 tech and just beneath engineering ) at Red Hat and so far its been fun and the challenges have kept me busy! My primary tasks are handling mainly userspace applications but some things tend to spill over into kernel land *cough*ppc64*cough*.I decided to stop using a hosting provider and just keep all documents, blog postings, etc on Google. I'm still keeping up a server at home for my domain but its mainly for small projects that more than likely will not go public.Other than that, not much on the configuration front other than cleaning up my vimrc and hopefully making it suitable for C and Python.Updated vimrc for VIM 7+ -- Works nicely with Python and C.
