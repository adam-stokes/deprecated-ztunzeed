Topic: rambo's mohawk
Date: 2008-02-02

Went and saw Rambo thursday night and it was probably the most violent film evar! I really enjoyed the blood, gibs, and the 50 cal. taking peoples heads clean off. I honestly did go into that movie knowing there was going to be no plot and just a lot of killing -- and knowing is half the battle.Not much happening on the home front, I've been digging into the arts of w0od and so far not doing a too bad of job. I've built a couple of things for my daughter like a baby stool and a toybox ( ill try to have pictures up later ). Also had the time to do a couple of weekend projects like a old time toolbox, step stool, and my latest project is going to be an antique style kitchen table.I got a little crazy this weekend and decided to start growing a mohawk -- though it's not going to be one of those off the wall spikey shits with color and whatnot.. No it's more like a minihawk -- just enough to show that its there and not to much to piss me off. I actually kinda like it and think I'll keep it around for a little bit.Finally, on the coding front I've got a project I'm working on that I can hopefully make independent enough to release to the public in order to provide more capabilities when gathering the necessary data to debug a core dump -- more on that later on.bye.
