Hi, several updates have come through for both RHEL4 and 5. If you've haven't had a chance to check out what sosreport does please head over to http://fedorahosted.org/sos for more information.We've added another addition to the family -- she's a german shepard mix (w/ chow) and is about 2.5 years old. She's great with the daughter and best of all is house broken already :)Anyway, enough for now as I don't feel like typing. :D
