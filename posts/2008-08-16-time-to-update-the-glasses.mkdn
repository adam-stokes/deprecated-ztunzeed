Topic: time to update the glasses
Date: 2008-08-16

Got around to going to the eye doctor today and when it was done and time to look for some new frames I was amazed at how expensive everything was. My insurance covers like 105 bucks for glasses and that doesn't even cover scratch protection and what not. GEE THANKS! *rant* You'd figure working at a company where you are on the computer 100% of the time eye care would be a bit better */rant*Anyway, luckily before I went some coworkers introduced me to http://glassyeyes.blogspot.com. So with prescription and PD in hand I went on the search for some glasses that would suit me. Of course I started off small only because it would've been pointless to go over the amount I would've paid at the eye doctor with insurance. So off I went and when the search was over I settled on :http://www.eyebuydirect.com/palmer-p-1376.htmlSimple pair of frames with scratch protection, uv protection, and all that other jazz. What was the total you ask? 50 bucks. Thats right, 50 friggin bucks and the eye doctors want to charge and arm and a leg for glasses that you don't exactly want and with only basic options on it. GG. So coming out on top with the eye doctors I was pleased with myself and gave the dog a bath.
