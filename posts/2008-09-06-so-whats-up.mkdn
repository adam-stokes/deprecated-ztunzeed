Topic: so.. whats up
Date: 2008-09-06

Recently got my new glasses in, aside from a little getting used to they are 50 bucks well spent!Been doing lots of python programming lately and have come across a third party module (pyprocessing) that makes managing pools of piped processes easier. Google it if interested.Doing a lot of work with a recent project of mine called CAS hope to have it community ready soon. Would like to have more involvement to really get things going with core analysis.SOSreport is still going strong, bug fixes and enhancements are made almost weekly!! I've been doing a lot of internal bug fixing that hasn't quite made its way to the public scm server but I'll try to get those up there soon. I've branched off to other sections, mainly RHEL5 and RHEL4, but theoritically they should be the same code. The reason you see differences is mainly because of time constraint and customer push. :)Anyway, thats it for now please check out sosreport if you haven't already. Robert Jackson was kind enough to add support for non-interactive mode which I know a lot of people wanted so its worth checking out. I should have that pushed to trunk soon. http://fedorahosted.org/sos/bye
