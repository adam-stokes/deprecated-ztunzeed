sos (sosreport) - pushed new enhancements to F-9/10 testing.http://fedorahosted.org/soscas (core analysis system) - just waiting on cvs setup and this will be available in Fedora/EPEL.http://fedorahosted.org/casIn addition to the above there are several interesting things coming down the pipe to help the customer be more proactive within cases and to simplify the gathering and analyzing of data from their side.
