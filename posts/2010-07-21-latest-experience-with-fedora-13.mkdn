What works for me:Bluetooth motorola headphones required one configuration change that was accessible through the gui.Wacom bamboo with the help of the latest driver from linuxwacom site. Once installed and kernel module loaded there was no need for further configuration.Google Chrome, Adobe AIR, Adobe Flash; I mention these primarily because all I had to do was click on the rpm's and once packagekit was done installing I was ready to go.What doesn't work:knetworkmanager-vpnc -&nbsp;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=605708Bugs found:python-pip and perl-pip conflict on /usr/bin/piphttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=616626https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=616399
