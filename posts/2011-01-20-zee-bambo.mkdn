Thanks to f14 bamboo how-to I managed to get my tablet up and playing
nicely. I've never really drew anything digitally so I decided to give
this tablet a try. The wacom is a little weird to get used to with
hovering of the stylus for mouse movements. Other than the awkwardness
I was able to put some form of a person together through the gimp. It's
not much and not really crisp and professional like some of these
other talented artists. Hopefully with some more practice I can save
trees and still keep drawing :)

Graphics applications for drawing:

```console
apt-get install gimp mypaint
```
